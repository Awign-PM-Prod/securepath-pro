# USE API PDF Button - Solution Summary

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

Added a **"USE API PDF"** button to the ops case details page that:

1. Generates CSV from form submissions
2. Calls the external PDF API
3. Opens the generated PDF in a new tab

## üìç Location

**Path**: `/ops/cases/[caseId]` ‚Üí **"Dynamic Forms" tab**

The button appears alongside "Download PDF" and "Download CSV" buttons.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Issue: CORS Error

You're experiencing a CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) error because:

- The PDF API server doesn't allow the `x-api-key` header from browsers
- This is a server-side configuration issue, **not a bug in your code**

## ‚úÖ Solution: Fix CORS on PDF API

You've chosen **Option 2**: Ask the PDF API owner to fix CORS.

### What Needs to Be Done

Share `PDF_API_CORS_FIX_REQUEST.md` with whoever controls the PDF API and ask them to:

1. Add `x-api-key` to allowed CORS headers
2. Handle OPTIONS preflight requests
3. Include CORS headers in all responses

### Files Created

- ‚úÖ `src/components/CaseManagement/CaseDetail.tsx` - Updated with the button
- ‚úÖ `PDF_API_CORS_FIX_REQUEST.md` - Documentation to share with API owner
- ‚úÖ `ALTERNATIVE_SOLUTION.md` - Additional solutions
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `supabase/functions/generate-pdf-proxy/` - Alternative solution (not in use)

## üîÑ After CORS is Fixed

Once the PDF API owner updates their CORS configuration, the button will work immediately. No code changes needed on your side.

## üß™ Testing

When CORS is fixed, clicking "USE API PDF" will:
1. Show loading state ("Generating...")
2. Call the API with CSV data
3. Display success toast
4. Open PDF URL in a new browser tab

## üìù Error Handling

The code includes specific error messages:
- **CORS Error**: Shows "PDF API server needs to allow x-api-key header"
- **API Error**: Shows the actual error from the API
- **Network Error**: Shows generic network error

## üîë API Details

- **API URL**: `https://stipkqfnfogxuegxgdba.supabase.co/functions/v1/generate-pdf`
- **API Key**: `qcpk_a1dcaccc6ac0433bb353528b1f25f828`
- **Method**: POST
- **Content-Type**: text/csv

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Next Steps

1. **Share** `PDF_API_CORS_FIX_REQUEST.md` with the API owner
2. **Wait** for them to update CORS configuration
3. **Test** the button again once fixed
