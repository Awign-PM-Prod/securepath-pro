# User Management Fixes - Test Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Z-Index Issue (Dropdown Behind Dialog)
**Problem**: Role dropdown was appearing behind the dialog box
**Solution**: 
- Added `z-[60]` class to `SelectContent` components
- Added `z-50` class to `DialogContent` components
- This ensures proper layering hierarchy

### 2. Edit Role Functionality
**Problem**: Edit button had no functionality
**Solution**:
- Created `EditUserDialog` component with full edit functionality
- Added edit state management to `UserList` component
- Implemented role-based permission checking for editing
- Added proper form validation and error handling

## Test Steps

### Test 1: Create User Dialog Z-Index
1. Login as Super Admin
2. Go to User Management
3. Click "Add User"
4. Click on the "Role" dropdown
5. **Expected**: Dropdown should appear above the dialog, not behind it
6. Select a role and verify it works properly

### Test 2: Edit User Functionality
1. In User Management, find any user you can edit
2. Click the Edit button (pencil icon)
3. **Expected**: Edit dialog should open with user's current information pre-filled
4. Try changing:
   - First Name
   - Last Name
   - Phone
   - Role (if you have permission)
   - Status (Active/Inactive)
5. Click "Update User"
6. **Expected**: User should be updated and list should refresh

### Test 3: Permission-Based Editing
1. Login as different roles and test editing permissions:
   - **Super Admin**: Can edit any user
   - **Ops Team**: Can only edit clients
   - **Vendor Team**: Can edit vendors and gig workers
   - **Vendor**: Can only edit gig workers

### Test 4: Form Validation
1. Try submitting edit form with:
   - Empty first name (should show error)
   - Empty last name (should show error)
   - Invalid data (should show appropriate errors)
