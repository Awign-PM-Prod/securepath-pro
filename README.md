# Background Verification System

A comprehensive background verification task management platform with role-based access control.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Step 1: Create First Super Admin User

Since this is a secure system with no public signup, create the first admin user manually:

**Using Supabase Dashboard** (Recommended):
1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Users](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ycbftnwzoxktoroqpslo/auth/users)
2. Click "Add user" 
3. Fill in:
   - **Email**: `admin@bgverification.com`
   - **Password**: `admin123` 
   - **User Metadata** (Important - copy exactly):
   ```json
   {
     "first_name": "System", 
     "last_name": "Administrator", 
     "role": "super_admin"
   }
   ```
4. Click "Create user"

### Step 2: Login & Test System
1. Visit the app and click "Sign In to Continue"
2. Login with: `admin@bgverification.com` / `admin123`
3. You'll be redirected to the Super Admin dashboard
4. Use "Add User" button to create team members

Detailed Solution:
Background Verification Platform ‚Äî Solution Document (with Capacity, Email Intake, Rate Cards)
1) Purpose & Outcomes
Build a web + mobile platform to run background-verification cases (aka ‚Äútickets‚Äù) from intake ‚Üí capacity-aware auto-allocation ‚Üí field execution ‚Üí QC ‚Üí reporting ‚Üí payouts, with:
Dynamic, capacity-aware auto-allocation that respects per-gig max capacity during the day, freeing slots as they finish cases.


Quality as a ranking factor (QC pass performance).


Automated email intake to create cases from a dedicated inbox.


Rate cards by pincode tier + completion-time slabs, with Ops overrides and post-assignment travel/bonus offers.


Client defaults and contracts (default TATs, SLAs).


Vendor-managed gig teams (add/remove, assign/reassign), payment routing (vendor vs direct gig), and rate visibility rules on mobile.



2) User Roles
Client (Phase 2 portal): Submit/view cases, download reports; defaults from client contract.


Ops Team: Intake (manual/bulk/email automation), oversee auto-allocation, handle exceptions, TAT & quality monitoring, payouts.


Vendor Management Team (VMT): Ensure supply coverage; respond to unallocated or low-capacity regions; onboard vendors/gigs.


QC Team: Review submissions; Pass/Reject/Rework; enforce quality policy.


Vendor (Org): Manage gig roster (add/remove), assign/reassign cases within its team; receives payments for vendor-routed work.


Gig Partner (Field): Accept/execute cases on mobile; if direct (not via vendor), they see task earnings; if via vendor, rate hidden.



3) Core Modules
Case Intake


Manual single/bulk (CSV).


Email Automation (Phase 1): Parse a dedicated inbox to create cases.


(Phase 2) Client portal/API.


Capacity-Aware Auto-Allocation & Reallocation


Rank by pincode coverage, capacity availability, performance, quality (QC pass), distance/ETA (optional).


Respect per-gig dynamic capacity; free capacity when a case is Submitted/QC-passed (configurable).


Case Acceptance & Execution (Mobile for gig/vendor).


QC Workbench (web).


Rate Cards & Pricing


Pincode tier √ó completion-time slab; Ops override + post-assignment travel/bonus offers.


Tracking & Alerts


Live status, TAT risk, capacity gaps, email-parsing failures.


Reporting & Payments


Client/ops reports; bi-weekly payouts with routing (vendor vs direct gig).



4) Lifecycle & States
Created ‚Üí Auto-Allocated ‚Üí Pending Acceptance ‚Üí Accepted ‚Üí In-Progress ‚Üí Submitted ‚Üí QC (Pass/Reject/Rework) ‚Üí Completed ‚Üí Reported ‚Üí In Payment Cycle
Transitions:
Acceptance SLA timer ‚áí reallocate if timeout/reject.


Capacity: On ‚ÄúAccepted‚Äù consume 1 slot of assignee; on Submitted/QC-Pass free 1 slot.


QC Reject/Rework loops back to assignee; capacity remains occupied (configurable: hold or free on Reject).



5) Capacity-Aware Auto-Allocation Engine
Inputs
Coverage: pincode match and active service area.


Capacity: capacity_available > 0 at allocation time.


Performance & Quality:


Completion rate (last N cases)


On-time completion rate (TAT adherence)


QC pass rate (quality)


Optional: recent load, distance/ETA, vendor priority.


Scoring (example, configurable)
Quality (QC pass): 0.35


Completion rate: 0.25


On-time completion: 0.25


Acceptance rate: 0.15
 (Tie-breakers: lower active load, closer distance, vendor priority)


Flow
Build candidate set by pincode & active status.


Filter for capacity_available > 0.


Rank by score; allocate to top candidate.


Start acceptance window (e.g., 30 min) ‚Üí nudge ‚Üí on timeout/reject auto-reallocate.


If no capacity anywhere ‚Üí Unallocated ‚Üí alert VMT (with pincode & demand).


Capacity Model
max_daily_capacity per gig (dynamic, editable by vendor/ops).


capacity_available = max_daily_capacity ‚àí active_assigned_count (+ configurable rule for when to free).


Capacity resets daily at a configured time; mid-day increases when cases move past the configured freeing state.



6) Rate Cards & Pricing Logic
Rate Card
Dimensions:


Pincode Tier (e.g., Tier-1 metro, Tier-2 city, Tier-3 town/rural).


Completion-time slab (e.g., within 24h, 48h, 72h).


Fields: base_rate_in_inr, optional travel_allowance_default, bonus_default.


Overrides & Incentives
Ops override at creation (set custom rate, TAT ‚Üí picks slab).


Post-assignment incentives: add travel or bonus to accelerate acceptance/completion; recorded as adjustments on the case payout.


Visibility rule (mobile):


Direct gigs: show total earning (base + incentive).


Vendor-routed gigs: hide rate; display ‚Äúvia vendor‚Äù.



7) Email Intake Automation (Phase 1)
Dedicated email (e.g., tickets@company.com).


Ingestion service (Gmail/IMAP/Graph):


Poll inbox, parse structured attachments (CSV/JSON/PDF) or email body (regex/templates).


Extract: client, subject, description, address, pincode (or geocode), TAT (if given), priority, attachments.


Create Case and trigger auto-allocation.


Error handling:


Unknown client ‚Üí route to Ops review.


Parse failure ‚Üí create Email Intake Error alert with original msg link.


Security: allow-listed sender domains per client.



8) Client Defaults & Contracts
Client Profile stores: default TAT(s) per case type, rate card mapping, allowed channels (email/drive/API), escalation contacts, SLA terms, report delivery preference (portal/email/webhook), contract effective dates.


On case creation (any channel), defaults apply unless overridden per case.



9) Vendor & Gig Management
Vendor Admin (web & mobile manager view):


Add/Remove gig partners (KYC, coverage pincodes, daily capacity).


Assign/Reassign cases within vendor‚Äôs roster (within capacity/security bounds).


View team metrics (load, acceptance, on-time, quality).


Payment Routing:


Vendor cases: payout to vendor; vendor handles intra-team split.


Direct gigs: payout to gig.


Visibility:


Vendors see negotiated vendor rates; gigs under vendors do not see task rates.



10) Workflows (Swimlane Summary)
Intake (Ops + System)
Email arrives ‚Üí parse ‚Üí Case created ‚Üí pincode geocoded if needed ‚Üí auto-allocate.


Manual single/bulk: same creation path ‚Üí auto-allocate.


Allocation & Capacity
Engine ranks eligible + capacity_available candidates ‚Üí allocate ‚Üí acceptance timer.


On accept: consume capacity; on submission/QC-pass (configurable), free capacity.


On reject/timeout: auto-reallocate; on exhaustion: raise Unallocated alert to VMT.


Field Execution (Gig/Vendor Mobile)
Receive assignment ‚Üí (Direct gig sees pay; vendor-gig does not) ‚Üí accept ‚Üí navigate ‚Üí capture images, GPS, answers ‚Üí submit.


QC (Web)
Queue ‚Üí open ‚Üí validate GPS/EXIF/checklist ‚Üí Pass/Reject/Rework with reason codes.


Rework: notify assignee; capacity rule applied per config (hold/free).


Reporting & Payments
Case report generated on QC Pass ‚Üí delivered per client setting.


Bi-weekly payout run ‚Üí route based on assignment type (vendor vs direct gig).


Adjustments from overrides/bonus captured in payout lines.

13) Mobile (Gig/Vendor)
Gig (Direct): Sees earning for each assignment (base + bonus/travel, if any).


Gig (Via Vendor): No earnings display (shows ‚Äúvia vendor‚Äù); rest identical.


Common: Assignments with acceptance timer, map & nav deeplink, guided checklist, photo capture (min count, anti-blur), GPS lock, offline queue & auto-sync, rework tasks.



14) Notifications & Alerts
Channels: SMS, WhatsApp, IVR, push, email.


Key events: Allocation, acceptance reminders, reallocation, QC results, capacity low in region, email parse failures, TAT risk/breach, report ready, payout posted.


Templates support variables (case_id, pincode, tat_hours, deeplink, etc.) and language.
